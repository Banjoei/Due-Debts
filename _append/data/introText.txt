round two and im back--cant beat me
so know if youre tryna take--me out it wont be so easy
throw all you want--throw everything you can
if im going to my grave--then you gotta make me
round two--i never been a quitter
rising to the top--you will be left behind
ive stared death in the face--and demons too
ill give--it my all
you better know you--wont catch me dead or alive
aint no paycheck--will make me meet my end
just barley outta reach--always a step ahead
wont catch me--dead or alive
wont catch me--dead or alive
wont catch me--dead or alive
wont catch me--dead or alive
i get the money--and its right on cue
you wanna be a boss?--do it like i do
rising to the top... wait...--FNF from the top real?
whatever you do...--DONT let him get away
time to make a--darnell shaped hole in the wall
chud chud--chud chud chud chud chud chud chud
this isn't obituary--...unless
wanted dead or alive--preferably dead
kill him! kill him please!--ill do anything!
for the love of god--please stop talking about indie plus
if you came to see frankenchud--go play spooky mix
play gooey mix--play gooey mix
everything--by everyone
